# Introduction

<!--Discuss remote attestation and mention some use cases.-->
Remote attestation is a security process which verifies and confirms the integrity and trustworthiness of a remote target (e.g., device, system, group of devices) in the network.
This process helps establish a level of trust in the remote system before allowing the device to e.g. join the network or get access to some sensitive information and resources.
The use cases that require remote attestation include secure boot and firmware management, cloud computing, network access control, etc.

<!--Summarize RATS architecture {{RFC9334}} and main roles.-->
The IETF working group Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) has defined an architecture {{RFC9334}} for remote attestation.
The three main roles in the RATS architecture are the Attester, the Verifier and the Relying Party.
The Attester generates evidence (a set of claims) concerning its identity and integrity, which must be appraised by the Verifier for its validity.
Then, the Verifier produces the attestation result, which is consequently used by the Relying Party for the purposes of reliably applying application-specific actions.

<!--Discuss the two RATS models and say that this specification supports both models.-->
One type of interaction model defined in the RATS architecture is called the background-check model.
It resembles the procedure of how employers perform background checks to determine the prospective employee's trustworthiness, by contacting the respective organization that issues a report.
In this case, the employer acts as the Relying Party, the employee acts as the Attester and the organization acts as the Verifier.
The Attester conveys evidence directly to the Relying Party and the Relying Party forwards the evidence to the Verifier for appraisal.
Once the attestation result is computed by the Verifier, it is sent back to the Relying Party to decide what action to take based on the attestation result.
Another model is called passport model, where the Attester communicates directly with the Verifier.
The Attester presents the evidence to the Verifier and gets an attestation result from the Verifier.
Then the Attester conveys the attestation result to the Relying Party.
This specification employs both the RATS background-check model and the passport model.

This document specifies the protocol between the Attester and the Relying Party.
The details of the protocol between the Relying Party and the Verifier in the background-check model, and the protocol between the Attester and the Verifier in the passport model are out of the scope.
This communication may be secured through protocols such as EDHOC, TLS or other security protocols that support the secure transmission to and from the Verifier.

<!--Discuss EAT-->
One way of conveying attestation evidence or the attestation result is the Entity Attestation Token (EAT) {{RFC9711}}.
It provides an attested claims set which can be used to determine a level of trustworthiness.
This specification relies on the EAT as the format for attestation evidence and the attestation result.

<!--Summarize EDHOC {{RFC9528}}. Mention EAD fields of EDHOC.-->
Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC) {{RFC9528}} is a lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol for highly constrained networks.
In EDHOC, the two parties involved in the key exchange are referred to as the Initiator (I) and the Responder (R).
EDHOC supports the transport of external authorization data, through the dedicated EAD fields.
This specification delivers EAT through EDHOC.
Specifically, EAT is transported as an EAD item.
This specification also defines new EAD items needed to perform remote attesation over EDHOC in {{bg}} and {{pp}}.

<!--Discuss implementation aspects such as the internal attestation service running on the Attester.
Root of trust. Separation between secure and non-secure worlds.-->
For the generation of evidence, the Attester incorporates an internal attestation service, including a specific trusted element known as the "root of trust".
Root of trust serves as the starting point for establishing and validating the trustworthiness appraisals of other components on the system.
The measurements signed by the attestation service are referred to as the Evidence.
The signing is requested through an attestation API.
How the components are separated between the secure and non-secure worlds on a target is out of scope of this specification.

# Conventions and Definitions
{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in EDHOC {{RFC9528}} and RATS architecture {{RFC9334}}.

# Overview

EDHOC provides the benefit of minimal message overhead and reduced round trips for lightweight authentication between an Initiator and a Responder.
However, authentication ensures only identity-level security, and additional integrity assurance may be required through remote attestation.
This specification describes how to perform remote attestation over the EDHOC protocol, following the RATS architecture.
More importantly, by integrating remote attestation with EDHOC, attestation can be run in parallel with authentication, improving the efficiency and maintaining lightweight properties.

Remote attestation protocol elements are carried within EDHOC's External Authorization Data (EAD) fields.
EDHOC {{RFC9528}} supports one or more EAD items in each EAD field.

The Attester can act as either the EDHOC Initiator or the EDHOC Responder, depending on the attesting target.
In the background-check model, the Attester (EDHOC Initiator/IoT device) exchanges evidence with the Relying Party (EDHOC Responder/Network service) during the EDHOC session.
In the passport model, the Attester (EDHOC Responder/Network service) exchanges the attestation result with the Relying Party (EDHOC Initiator/IoT device) during the EDHOC session.
{{attestation-dimensions}} defines two independent dimensions for performing remote attestation over EDHOC:

  1. Target (see {{iot}}, {{net}}) defining the entity that undergoes the attestation process (EDHOC Initiator or EDHOC Responder), which could be constrained device or not.
  2. Model (see {{bg}}, {{pp}}) defining the attestation model in use based on the RATS architecture (background-check model or passport model).

This document specifies the cases that are suited for constrained IoT environments.
See this document {{I-D.ietf-iotops-7228bis}} as a reference for classification of IoT devices.

The remote attestation operation defined in this document preserves the properties of EDHOC:

  1. The EDHOC protocol is not modified, the remote attestation elements are carried within EDHOC EAD fields.
  2. The attestation protocol is in parallel but does not interfere with the authentication flow.
  3. The privacy and security properties of EDHOC are not changed.

# Assumptions

In the background-check model, the Verifier is assumed to support verification of at least one evidence format provided by the Attester.
The Verifier is assumed to be provisioned with the Attester's attestation public key and the reference values required for evidence validation prior to the attestation procedure.
It is assumed that the Relying Party also has knowledge about the Attester, so it can narrow down the evidence type selection and send to the Attester only one format of the evidence type.

In the passport model, the credential identity of the Verifier is assumed to be stored at the Attester and the Relying Party, which means the Verifier is trusted by the Attester and the Relying Party to obtain the attestation result.
If timestamps are used to ensure freshness in the passport model, synchronized time between the Attester and Relying Party is assumed.
For detailed time considerations, refer to {{Appendix A of RFC9334}}.
If nonce is used to ensure freshness, the device who generates the nonce is assumed to be able to generate a random byte string that is not predictable.

## Reuse of EDHOC

This specification reuses several components of EDHOC.

* EAD is the External Authorization Data message field of EDHOC messages, see {{Section 3.8 of RFC9528}}.
This specification specifies four new EAD items in background-check model, and four new EAD items in passport model (see {{attestation-dimensions}}).
* ID_CRED_I is used to identify the Initiator identity in the authentication session.
* EDHOC hash algorithm of the selected cipher suite is used to generate the attestation_binder_m3 (see {{attestation-binder}}) when Evidence is sent in EDHOC message_3.
* EDHOC_Exporter is used to generate the attestation_binder_m4 (see {{attestation-binder}}) when Evidence is sent in EDHOC message_4.

# Remote Attestation in EDHOC {#attestation-dimensions}

This section specifies two independent dimensions that characterize the remote attestation process over EDHOC.

  1. Target: Defines the entity that undergoes the attestation process.
  2. Model: Defines the attestation models based on RATS architecture.
This specification supports both the RATS background-check model (see {{bg}}) and the passport model (see {{pp}}).
The corresponding EAD items for background-check model and the passport model are independent of each other.

The EDHOC protocol defines two possible message flows, namely the EDHOC forward message flow and the EDHOC reverse message flow (see {{Appendix A.2.2 of RFC9528}}).
In this specification, the instantiations in {{attestation-combinations}} focus on the EDHOC forward message flow, but both flows are supported to perform remote attestation.

## Target: Initiator Attestation (I) {#iot}

The Initiator acts as the Attester.

## Target: Responder Attestation (R) {#net}

The Responder acts as the Attester.

## Model: Background-check Model (BG) {#bg}

In the background-check model, the Attester sends the evidence to the Relying Party.
Evidence contains a set of claims about the current status of the Attester, including configurations, health or construction that have security relevance (see {{Section 8.1 of RFC9334}}).
The Relying Party transfers the evidence to the Verifier and gets back the attestation result from the Verifier.

An EDHOC session is established between the Attester and the Relying Party.
A negotiation of the evidence type is required before the Attester sends the evidence.
All three parties must agree on a selected evidence type.

The Attester first sends a list of the proposed evidence types to the Relying Party.
The list is formatted as an Attestation proposal in an EDHOC EAD item.
The Relying Party relays the list to the Verifier and receives at least one supported evidence type from the Verifier in return.
If the Relying Party receives more than one evidence type, a single evidence type should be selected by the Relying Party based on its knowledge of the Attester.
The Relying Party then sends it back within the Attestation request to the Attester.

A nonce, at least 8-bytes long {{RFC9711}}), guarantees the freshness of the attestation session.
The nonce is generated by the Verifier and sent to the Relying Party.
The Relying Party puts the nonce and the selected evidence type together in a tuple to generate an Attestation request.

Once the Attester receives the Attestation request, it can call its attestation service to generate the evidence, with the nonce value as one of the inputs.

The ead_label for Attestation_proposal, Attestation_request and Evidence is the same (TBD1) because these EAD items appear in distinct positions within the EDHOC message in sequence.

### Attestation_proposal {#attestation-proposal}

To propose a list of provided evidence types in background-check model, the Attester transports the Proposed_EvidenceType object.
It signals to the Relying Party the proposal to do remote attestation, as well as which types of the attestation claims the Attester supports.
The Proposed_EvidenceType is encoded in CBOR in the form of a sequence.

The EAD item for an attestation proposal is:

* ead_label = TBD1
* ead_value = Attestation_proposal, which is a CBOR byte string:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attestation_proposal = bstr .cbor Proposed_EvidenceType

Proposed_EvidenceType = [ + content-format ]

content-format = uint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where

* Proposed_EvidenceType is an array that contains all the supported evidence types by the Attester.
* There MUST be at least one item in the array.
* content-format is an indicator of the format type (e.g., application/eat+cwt with an appropriate eat_profile parameter set), from {{IANA-CoAP-Content-Formats}}.

### Attestation_request {#attestation-request}


As a response to the attestation proposal, the Relying Party signals to the Attester the supported and requested evidence type.
In case none of the evidence types is supported, the Relying Party rejects the previous message with an error indicating support for another evidence type.

The EAD item for an attestation request is:

* ead_label = TBD1
* ead_value = Attestation_request, which is a CBOR byte string:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attestation_request = bstr .cbor Selected_EvidenceType

Selected_EvidenceType = (
  content-format: uint,
  nonce: bstr .size (8..64)
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where

* content-format is the selected evidence type by the Relying Party and supported by the Verifier.
* nonce is generated by the Verifier and forwarded by the Relying Party.

### Evidence {#evidence}

The Attester calls its local attestation service to generate and return a serialized Entity Attestation Token (EAT) {{RFC9711}} as Evidence.

The EAD item is:

* ead_label = TBD1
* ead_value is a serialized EAT in COSE_Sign1 structure.

For remote attestation over EDHOC, The EAT MUST be formatted as a CBOR Web Token (CWT) containing attestation-oriented claims.
The complete set of attestation claims for the EAT is specified in {{RFC9711}}.
An example is provided in Section {{firmware}}.

A minimal claims set is defined as the payload of COSE_Sign1 when the Attester operates under constrained message size requirements and/or limited computational resources:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{
/eat-nonce/          10: bstr .size 8
/ueid/               256: bstr .size (7..33)
/measurements/       273: measurements-type
}

measurements-type = [+ measurements-format]
measurements-format = [
      content-format: uint,
      content: bytes
]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where

* The "measurements" claim could be a CoSWID {{RFC9393}}, a CoRIM {{I-D.ietf-rats-corim}} or other claim formats, and MUST be identified by CoAP Content Format.
An example as CoSWID is shown in {{firmware}}.

#### Attestation binder {#attestation-binder}

The signature over the Evidence MUST include an attestation binder.
The inclusion of the attestation binder is to cryptographically bind the attestation to the authentication, and to ensure that the attester is the authenticated peer.
The attestation binder prevents relay attacks whereby an attacker relays Evidence generated in a different session.

When Evidence is sent in EDHOC message_3 in EAD_3, the attestation binder is computed using HKDF-Expand defined in {{RFC5869}}.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
attestation_binder_m3 = HKDF-Expand(0, attest_info, hash_length)

attest_info = [ H_12, "attestation", ID_CRED_I ]

H_12 = H(H(message_1), message_2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where

* hash_length is the length of the output size of the selected EDHOC hash algorithm.
* attest_info is a CBOR array containing H_12, the text string "attestation" and ID_CRED_I.
* H() is the EDHOC hash algorithm of the selected cipher suite.

When Evidence is sent in EDHOC message_4, the attestation binder is derived using EDHOC_Exporter defined in {{RFC9528}}.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
attestation_binder_m4 = EDHOC_Exporter (exporter_label, context, length)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where

* exporter_label = 2
* context = "attestation"
* length = 32

The signature in COSE_Sign1 is computed over a Sig_structure containing protected header, externally supplied data (external_aad) and payload using a private attestation key.
The message to be signed is:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[ "Signature1", body_protected, external_aad, payload ]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where

* body_protected is the same CBOR byte string as the protected header in COSE_Sign1
* external_aad is set to attestation_binder_m3 when Evidence is carried in EDHOC message_3, and to attestation_binder_m4 when Evidence is carried in EDHOC message_4
* payload is the same CBOR byte string as the payload in COSE_Sign1

### trigger_bg {#trigger-bg}

The EAD item trigger_bg is used when the Relying Party triggers the Attester to start a remote attestation in the background-check model.
The Attester MUST reply with an EAD item corresponding to the background-check model, either an attestation_proposal in {{attestation-proposal}} or an evidence in {{evidence}}.
The ead_value MUST not be present, as the ead_label serves as the trigger.

The EAD item is:

* ead_label = TBD3
* ead_value = null

## Model: Passport Model (PP) {#pp}

In the passport model, the Attester sends the evidence to the Verifier.
After the Attester receives the attestation result from the Verifier, the Attester sends the attestation result to the Relying Party.
The attestation result may carry a boolean value indicating compliance or non-compliance with a Verifier's apprasal policy, or many carry a set of claims to indicate the results in different aspects ({{Section 8.4 of RFC9334}}).

An EDHOC session is established between the Attester (EDHOC Responder) and the Relying Party (EDHOC Initiator).
The Attester and the Relying Party should decide from which Verifier the Attester obtains the attestation result and transfers it to the Relying Party.
The Attester first sends a list of the Verifier identities that it can get the attestation result.
The Relying Party selects one trusted Verifier identity and sends it back as a Result request.

Regarding the freshness in passport model, the Attester could either establish a real-time connection with the selected Verifier, or use a pre-stored attestation result from the selected Verifier.
If the attestation result is not obtained via a real-time connection, it MUST include a time stamp and/or expiry time to indicate its validity.
Time synchronization is out of scope of this specification.

Once the Attester obtains the attestation result from the selected Verifier, it sends the attestation result to the Relying Party.

The ead_label for Result_proposal, Result_request and Result is the same (TBD2) because these EAD items appear in distinct and fixed positions within the EDHOC message sequence.
Specifically, they are conveyed in EAD_2, EAD_3, and EAD_4 of EDHOC messaage_2, EDHOC message_3, and EDHOC message_4, respectively.
As their positions identify each item, separate labels are not required.

### Result_proposal {#result-proposal}

An attestation result proposal contains the identification of the credentials of the Verifiers to indicate Verifiers' indentities.
The identification of credentials relies on COSE header parameters {{IANA-COSE-Header-Parameters}}, with a header label and credential value.

The EAD item for the attestation result proposal is:

* ead_label = TBD2
* ead_value = Result_proposal, which is a CBOR byte string:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Result_proposal = bstr .cbor Proposed_VerifierIdentity
Proposed_VerifierIdentity = [ + VerifierIdentity ]

VerifierIdentity = {
  label => values
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where

* Proposed_VerifierIdentity is defined as a list of one or more VerifierIdentity elements.
* Each VerifierIdentity within the list is a map defined in {{IANA-COSE-Header-Parameters}} that:
    * label = int / tstr
    * values = any


### Result_request {#result-request}

As a response to the attestation result proposal, the Relying Party signals to the Attester the trusted Verifier.
In case none of the Verifiers can be trusted by the Relying Party, the session is aborted.
Relying Party generates a nonce to ensure the freshness of the attestation result from the Verifier.

The EAD item for an attestation result request is:

* ead_label = TBD2
* ead_value = Result_request, which is a CBOR byte string:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Result_request = bstr .cbor Request_structure

Request_structure = {
  selected_verifier: VerfierIdentity,
  ? nonce: bstr .size (8..64)
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Result {#result}

The attestation result is generated and signed by the Verifier as a serialized EAT {{RFC9711}}.
The Relying Party can decide what action to take with regards to the Attester based on the information elements in attetation result.

The EAD item is:

* ead_label = TBD2
* ead_value is a serialized EAT.

### trigger_pp {#trigger-pp}

The EAD item trigger_pp is used when the Relying Party triggers the Attester to start a remote attestation in the passport model.
The Attester MUST reply with an EAD item corresponding to the passport model, either a result proposal in {{result-proposal}} or a result in {{result}}.
The ead_value MUST not be present, as the ead_label serves as the trigger.

The EAD item is:

* ead_label = TBD4
* ead_value = null

# Instantiation of Remote Attestation Protocol {#attestation-combinations}

We use the format (Target, Model) to denote instantiations.
In particular:

* I means that the EDHOC Initiator is the Attester.
* R means that the EDHOC Responder is the Attester.
* BG denotes the background-check model.
* PP denotes the passport model.

For example, (I, BG) represents the Initiator as an Attester performing attestation using the background-check model.
The four possible instantiations are therefore: (I, BG), (R, PP), (R, BG), and (I, PP).
In the remainder of this section we provide examples of these instantiations, starting with two instances of constrained Initiator followed by two instances of constrained Responder.

## (I, BG): EDHOC Initiator Attestation in the Background-check Model {#iot-attestation}

In this instantiation, the constrained EDHOC Initiator acts as the RATS Attester and the EDHOC Responder acts as the RATS Relying Party.
An overview of EDHOC Initiator attestation in the background-check model is illustrated in {{fig-iot-bg-fwd}}.
The Attester and the Relying Party communicate by transporting messages within EDHOC's External Authorization Data (EAD) fields.
An external entity plays the role of the RATS Verifier (V).
The EAD items specific to the background-check model are defined in {{bg}}.

The Attester starts the attestation by sending an Attestation proposal in EDHOC message_1.
The Relying Party generates EAD_2 with the received evidence type(s) and nonce from the Verifier, and sends an Attestation request to the Attester.
The Attester generates the Evidence with the attestation binder embedded and sends the Evidence to the Relying Party in EAD_3.
The Relying Party verifies the attestation binder and then sends the Evidence together with the attestation binder to the Verifier.
The Verifier evaluates the Evidence and sends the Attestation result to the Relying Party.

A common use case for (I, BG) is to attest an IoT device (EDHOC Initiator) to a network server (EDHOC Responder).
For example, a simple illustrative example is performing remote attestation to verify that the latest version of firmware is running on the IoT device before the network server allows it to join the network (see {{firmware}}).

## (R, PP): EDHOC Responder Attestation in the Passport Model {#network-attestation}

In this instantiation, the constrained EDHOC Initiator acts as the RATS Relying Party and the EDHOC Responder acts as the RATS Attester.
An overview of the message flow is illustrated in {{fig-net-pp-fwd}}.
The EAD items specific to the passport model are defined in {{pp}}.

The Relying Party asks the Attester to do a remote attestation by sending a trigger_pp (see {{trigger-pp}}) in EDHOC message_1.
The Attester replies to the Relying Party with a Result proposal in EAD_2.
Then the Relying Party selects a trusted Verifier identity and sends it as a Result request.
How the Attester negotiates with the selected Verifier to get the attestation result is out of scope of this specification.
A fourth EDHOC message is required to send the Result from the Attester to the Relying Party.

One use case for (R, PP) is when a network server (EDHOC Responder) needs to attest itself to a client (e.g., an IoT device (EDHOC Initiator)).
For example, the client needs to send some sensitive data to the network server, which requires the network server to be attested first.

## (R, BG): EDHOC Responder Attestation in the Background-check Model {#r_bg}

In this instantiation, the constrained EDHOC Responder acts as the RATS Attester and the EDHOC Initiator acts as the RATS Relying Party.
An overview of the message flow is illustrated in {{fig-r-bg}}.
The EAD items specific to the background-check model are defined in {{bg}}.

The Relying Party initiates the procedure by sending trigger_bg in EAD_1 of message_1.
The Attester responds with an Attestation proposal in EAD_2 of message_2, indicating the evidence types it can provide.
The Relying Party forwards this proposal to the Verifier, which selects its supported evidence types and provides a nonce.
The Relying Party then sends an Attestation request in EAD_3 of message_3.
Upon receipt of the Attestation request, the Attester generates the Evidence with the attestation binder embedded and returns it in EAD_4 of message_4.
The Relying Party forwards the Evidence to the Verifier and receives an Attestation result.

Note that this is a post-handshake attestation since EDHOC completes the authenticated key exchange after message_3.
Therefore, the attestation binder in this instantiation is derived using EDHOC_Exporter (see {{attestation-binder}}).

# Mutual Attestation in EDHOC {#mutual-attestation}

In this section we demonstrate mutual attestation over EDHOC combining the cases  (I, BG), see {{iot-attestation}}, and (R, PP), see {{network-attestation}}, which is potentially the most relevant mutual attestation example for constrained IoT environments.
This demonstrates combined mutual authentication with mutual attestation at a reduced message overhead and number of round trips.

## (I, BG) - (R, PP)

In this example, the mutual attestation is performed in EDHOC forward message flow, by one IoT device attestation in background-check model and another network service attestation in passport model.
The process is illustrated in {{fig-mutual-attestation-BP}}.
How the Network service connects with the Verifier_1 and potential Verifier_2 is out of scope in this specification.

The first remote attestation is initiated by the IoT device (A_1) in background-check model.
In parallel, the IoT device (A_1) requests the network service (A_2) to perform a remote attestation in passport model.
EAD_2 carries the EAD items Attestation request and Result proposal.
EAD_3 carries the EAD items Evidence and Result request.
EAD_4 carries the EAD item Result for the passport model.

# Verifier

The Verifier maintains an explicit trust relationship with the Attester, whereby the Verifier is provisioned with the Attester's attestation public key prior to the remote attestation process.
This explicit relationship may be established through various means, such as manufacturer provisioning, trusted certification authorities, or direct configuration.
Reference values used for comparison against received evidence should also be provided to the Verifier before the attesation.
The evaluation policy employed by the Verifier varies according to specific use cases and should be determined prior to the attestation; such policy definition is out of scope in this specification.

The Verifier maintains an implicit trust relationship with the Relying Party, established through mechanisms such as web PKI with trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, enabling the Relying Party to trust the attestation result that is generated by the Verifier.

## Processing in the Background-check Model

The Verifier is connected with the Relying Party and is responsible for evaluating evidence forwarded by the Relying Party.
After the Relying Party receives EDHOC message_1 from the Attester, it extracts and transmits the Attestation proposal to the Verifier.
The Verifier must support at least one evidence type for evaluation, otherwise it returns an empty list.
Alongside the selected evidence type, the Verifier generates a random nonce and sends both elements to the Relying Party.

When the Relying Party obtains EDHOC message_3, it forwards the evidence and the attestation binder (see {{attestation-binder}}) to the Verifier for evaluation.

The evidence evaluation process SHOULD include the signature verification, nonce validation, and comparison of measurement values against trusted reference values.
An example evaluation procedure for evidence formatted as an Entity Attestation Token (EAT) within a COSE_Sign1 structure is as follows:

1. Decode the COSE_Sign1 structure and extract constituent components: headers, payload, signature.
2. Verify the signature using the Attester's attestation public key.
The Verifier reconstructs the Sig_Structure, with the attestation binder carried in the external_add field.
3. Verify that the nonce exists in the Verifier's local nonce list. If the nonce is found, validation passes and the nonce is removed from the list to prevent replay attacks.
4. Compare the received evidence measurement values against the reference value.
The attestation result is returned to the Relying Party, with result generation conforming to the attestation token format defined in {{RFC9711}}.

## Processing in the Passport Model

When the Attester utilizes a cached attestation result previously generated by the Verifier, real-time re-evaluation by the Verifier is not required.
If the Attester receives result_request from the Relying Party and performs real-time attestation with the Verifier, the Verifier then generates the attestation result formatted as an Entity Attestation Token (EAT).
The token uses the "Software Measurement Results (measres)" claim as defined in {{RFC9711}}, and incorporates the nonce generated by the Relying Party as an input parameter.


# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

This specification is performed over EDHOC {{RFC9528}} by using EDHOC's EAD fields.
The privacy considerations of EADs in EDHOC apply to this specification.

EAD_1 is not resistant to either active attackers or passive attackers, because neither the Initiator nor the Responder has been authenticated.

Although EAD_2 is encrypted, the Initiator has not been authenticated, rendering EAD_2 vulnerable against the active attackers.

The ead items in EAD_1 and EAD_2 MAY be very specific and potentially reveal sensitive information about the device.
The leaking of the data in EAD_1 and/or EAD_2 MAY risk to be used by the attackers for malicious purposes.
Data in EAD_3 and EAD_4 are protected between the Initiator and the Responder in EDHOC.

Mutual attestation carries a lower risk for EAD items when the Responder is the Attester.
For the mutual attestation at the EDHOC Responder, only the Attestation_proposal/Result_proposal in EAD_2 is not protected to active attackers.
Both the Attestation_request/Result_request in EAD_3 and the Evidence/Result in EAD_4 are protected.

The privacy considerations of remote attestation refer to {{Section 11 of RFC9334}}.

# IANA Considerations

## EDHOC External Authorization Data Registry

IANA is requested to register the following entry in the "EDHOC External Authorization Data" registry under the group name "Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over Cose (EDHOC)".

* The ead_label = TBD1 corresponds to the ead_value Attestation_proposal in {{attestation-proposal}}, Attestation_request in {{attestation-request}} and Evidence in {{evidence}}.
* The ead_label = TBD2 corresponds to the ead_value Result_proposal in {{result-proposal}}, Result_request in {{result-request}} and the Result in {{result}}.
* The ead_label = TBD3 corresponds to the EAT item trigger_bg as specified in {{trigger-bg}}.
* The ead_label = TBD4 corresponds to the EAT item trigger_pp as specified in {{trigger-pp}}.

# Example: Device Onboarding: Firmware Version Check {#firmware}

The goal in this device onboarding example is to verify that the firmware running on the device is the latest version, and is neither tampered or compromised.
The objective of onboarding is both authentication and integrity verification.
If either one is compromised, the objective fails.
In particular, if the attestation private key is leaked, the device firmware can no longer be trusted, so the value of valid authentication is significantly reduced.

In this example, a device acts as the Attester, currently in an untrusted state.
The Attester needs to generate the evidence to attest itself.
A gateway that can communicate with the Attester and can control its access to the network acts as the Relying Party.
The gateway will finally decide whether the device can join the network or not depending on the attestation result.
The attestation result is produced by the Verifier, which is a web server that can be seen as the manufacturer of the device.
Therefore it can appraise the evidence that is sent by the Attester.
The remote attestation session starts with the Attester sending EAD_1 in EDHOC message 1.

An example of the EAD_1 in EDHOC message_1 could be:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[60,61,258]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Verifier and the Relying Party can support at least one evidence type that is proposed by the Attester, the Relying Party will include in the EAD_2 field the same evidence type, alongside a nonce for message freshness.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(258, h'a29f62a4c6cdaae5')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Evidence in EAD_3 field is an Entity Attestation Token (EAT) {{RFC9711}}, with the measurements claim formatted in CoSWID{{RFC9393}}.
The Evidence is in COSE_Sign1 structure, where the payload of COSE_Sign1 contains the following claims:

The Relying Party (co-located with the gateway) then treats the Evidence as opaque and sends it together with the hash value of the first two EDHOC messages to the Verifier.
Once the Verifier sends back the Attestation Result, the Relying Party can be assured on the version of the firmware that the device is running.

# Re-attestation

The trust relationship established during the initial EDHOC exchange may become outdated over time due to changes in device state.
To maintain a valid trust relationship, a peer may require updated assurance periodically.
This section presents two re-attestation approaches: re-attestation during EDHOC resumption and re-attestation using OSCORE.

## Intra-handshake Re-attestation using EDHOC Resumption with PSK

Remote attestation can be applied during EDHOC session resumption using EDHOC-PSK, as defined in {{Section 6 of I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}}.
This enables re-attestation without public key based authentication.

## Post-handshake Re-attestation using OSCORE

Post-handshake attestation can be performed after an EDHOC session using Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) {{RFC8613}}.
EDHOC is then used to establish an OSCORE Security Context, as specified in {{RFC9668}}.
OSCORE provides application-layer protection for RESTful message exchanges, for example the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which can be used to carry attestation information.

Post-handshake attestation decouples attestation process from the initial handshake, enabling re-attestation throughout the session lifetime and guaranteeing the runtime integrity.

### Flight 1

The CoAP client (Attester) initiates attestation with a CoAP request:

* The request method is POST.
* The Uri-path is set to ".well-known/attest".
* The payload is the Attestation_proposal CBOR sequence, where Attestation_proposal is constructed as defined in {{attestation-proposal}}.

### Flight 2

The CoAP server (Relying Party) receives the request and processes it as described in {{bg}} then prepares Attestation_request as defined in {{attestation-request}}.
The CoAP server maps the message to a CoAP response:

* The response code is 2.04 Changed.
* The payload is the Attestation_request CBOR sequence, as defined in {{attestation-request}}.

### Flight 3

The CoAP client (Attester) receives the response and processes it as described in {{bg}} then generates the evidence.
The CoAP client maps the message to a CoAP request:

* The request method is POST.
* The Uri-path is set to ".well-known/attest".
* The payload is the Evidence CBOR sequence, as defined in {{evidence}}.

## Differences between Intra-handshake and Post-handshake Attestation

Intra-handshake attestation embeds evidence exchange into the authentication handshake, cryptographically tying identity to device state and blocking unauthenticated and untrusted devices from completing the handshake.
Post-handshake attestation separates attestation from the authentication handshake, providing modularity that allows attestation mechanisms to be integrated independently of the handshake protocol.
This section compares the two different types of remote attestation methods in terms of performance and security properties.

### Performance properties

Intra-handshake attestation provides round-trip efficiency as attestation occurs within the handshake, requiring no additional round trips.
The intra-handshake attestation defined in this document does not modify the EDHOC protocol itself, though other intra-handshake designs may require changes.
Post-handshake has higher modularity which the attestation is integrated independently but it requires additional round trips.


### Security properties

Remote attestation provides security properties including evidence integrity, freshness guarantees, and replay protection.
Besides, intra-handshake attestation is cryptographically bound to the authentication process, and the trust is established before the session begins.
Post-handshake attestation gurantees the runtime integrity which can obtain dynamic mesurements during device execution, and can be repeatedly performed throughout the session which has the continuous assurance.
